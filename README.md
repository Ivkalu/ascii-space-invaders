# ASCII Space Invaders

This repo is a proof of concept. Concept in this case, of course, is the ascii game in python. 
It uses common video game logic with classic game loop: 
- update()
- display()

Loop uses framerate limiter to make display less buggy if there is processing a spike.
### How to run

Create new env:

`
python3 -m venv venv
`

Activate:

`
source venv/bin/activate
`

Install requirements:

`
pip install -r requirements.txt
`

Run game.py:

python3 game.py

### Fin Fun

Have fun and rock those motherfudging space invaders! Nobody will invade "my" space. :-)
